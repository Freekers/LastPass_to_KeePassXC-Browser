# LastPass_to_KeePassXC-Browser.R
R script which cleans up your LastPass csv export to increase compatibility with KeePassXC-Browser's Autofill

This R script will clean up your LastPass csv export to increase compatibility with KeePassXC-Browser's Autofil.
It will extract the top level domain from each and every site in your export

Note: I am new to R. This script can probably be optimized in many ways, feel free to submit a PR.
